# Counting Chickens

#### By Ed Millington

This will be a MEAN app that allows backyard farmers to keep track of eggs laid by their chooks.

## What's here so far?

Nothing much.

I've set up a mongo DB and am hosting it on heroku: <a href="https://counting-chickens.herokuapp.com">https://counting-chickens.herokuapp.com</a>

I've created a collection of "users", and have added one user via cURL to check that the DB is working.
