# Counting Chickens

#### By Ed Millington

This will be a MEAN app that allows backyard farmers to keep track of eggs laid by their chooks.

## What will the functionality be?

1) User can set up an account and log in
2) User can add as many chickens to their account as they want
3) User records eggs laid by each of their chickens
4) User can view historic lays in the form of simple line graphs / tables

## What's here so far?

Nothing much.

I've set up a mongo DB and am hosting it on heroku: <a href="https://counting-chickens.herokuapp.com">https://counting-chickens.herokuapp.com</a>

I've created a collection of "users", and a simple UI to add / edit users (first name, last name, email).
